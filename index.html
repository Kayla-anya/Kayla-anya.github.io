<h2>My KWK and coding Journey</h2>
<p>I first started Kode with Klossy in the summer of 2021 where I was introduced to Web Development.
    The next year I returened to Kode with Klossy to learn more about Data Science using various coding languages.including Python and SQL.
    This year 2025, I am back doing BWDC X KWK for a data challenge.

    My coding journey started in 2020, when I was incredibly bored during the pandemic and wanted to learn how to code.
    I started with HTML and CSS using a free app. Prior to coding, I attended a summercamp where I learned to program Lego Ev3 robots.
    This kickstarted my interest in coding and I have been coding ever since.
